## FAQ

### Does Tune Out use tracking or advertising?

Tune Out is a zero telemetry application.
It sends no identifying information to any individual stations or sites.
The individual stations, however, may elect to serve advertisements
in their content streams.
Since your approximate geographical location can be inferred
from your IP address, this may result in hearing advertisements
that are local to your network entry point, even for stations
originating from another country.

### Where does Tune Out get its station list?

Tune Out uses the station database from the free
[RadioBrowser](https://www.radio-browser.info/) catalog.
